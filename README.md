Cisco Packet Tracer LAN Configuration Project Overview

Description:
This project demonstrates the configuration of a Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network comprises 3 PCs, 1 switch, and 1 router, following a hierarchical design model. The router manages the network using Layer 3 (IP addressing), and the PCs are connected to the switch, which, in turn, is connected to the router at the Access Layer.

Key Components:

    3 PCs
    1 Switch
    1 Router

Project Highlights:

    Configured Cisco switches in a simulated environment.
    Implemented a LAN setup with IP addressing and hierarchical design.
    Utilized Cisco Packet Tracer for modeling and simulation.

Files:

    Small LAN Configuration.pkt: Cisco Packet Tracer file with the configured LAN model.
